# Smart-Surveillance-System-with-Real-Time-Threat-Detection


## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **real-time object detection system** using **YOLOv5/v8** and **Streamlit**. It can detect various objects (e.g., people, vehicles, traffic signs, weapons) from both uploaded videos and live webcam feeds. The system can be deployed for applications in **security surveillance**, **public safety**, **traffic monitoring**, and **military operations**.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Detects multiple objects (people, vehicles, weapons, etc.) in videos and live webcam feeds.
- **Dangerous Object Alerts**: Sends **instant alerts** using **AWS SNS** when dangerous objects like knives, guns, or bombs are detected.
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Saves detection results (object data) automatically to **AWS S3** for secure storage and backup.
- **Data Visualization and Analytics**: Provides interactive graphs, charts, and summaries for analysis of detected objects using **Plotly**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.
- **Easy-to-use Web Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for a user-friendly experience, allowing easy video upload and live webcam stream.
